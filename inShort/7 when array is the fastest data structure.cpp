✅ 1. Direct Index Access (Random Access)

Arrays store elements contiguously in memory.
This makes arrays faster than linked lists, trees, 
hash maps etc. for random access.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    cout << arr[3] << endl; // O(1) -> prints 40
    return 0;
}

















































✅ 2. Sequential Iteration / Traversal

Iterating through an array is very fast due to cache locality.
Since all elements are stored next to each other in memory, 
CPU caching and prefetching make iteration faster compared 
to linked lists.



























































✅ 3. Fixed-size Data (No Dynamic Resizing Needed)

If you know the size of data in advance, arrays are best since:
No extra memory overhead (like pointers in linked lists).
No resizing overhead (like vectors when they expand).
This makes them memory efficient and faster.




























































✅ 4. When Insertion/Deletion is Rare

If the workload mostly involves reading and iterating, 
not inserting/deleting, arrays are faster.
Example: Lookup tables, static datasets 
(like days of week, months, ASCII codes).






























































































⚡ Summary:
Arrays are fastest when:
You need O(1) random access.
You’re mostly doing reads/traversals.
Data size is known and fixed.
You want maximum cache efficiency.

They are not fastest when frequent insertions/deletions 
in the middle are required — there, linked lists or other 
dynamic structures can be better.
