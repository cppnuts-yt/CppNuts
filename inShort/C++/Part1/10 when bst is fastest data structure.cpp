1. Searching in Dynamic Sorted Data

In a balanced BST (like AVL or Red-Black Tree), searching,
insertion, and deletion are all O(log n). So, if you need 
sorted data with frequent updates, a BST is faster.
























































2. Fast Min/Max / Successor / Predecessor

In a BST:
min = leftmost node (O(log n))
max = rightmost node (O(log n))
successor/predecessor queries are natural and efficient.
This makes BSTs great for problems like 
"next greater element" or "range queries."























































3. Efficient Range Queries

If you want all keys between [L, R]:
Array/vector: binary search + scanning → O(log n + k) but
insert/delete costly.

BST: In-order traversal → O(log n + k).
BST shines when the dataset is changing dynamically.






















































4. Hierarchical Relationships in Sorted Data

BSTs naturally represent hierarchical ordering.
Useful for interval trees, segment trees.























































5. Dynamic Ordered Sets / Maps

In C++, std::set and std::map are implemented as balanced
BSTs (Red-Black trees).
They allow fast insert, search, delete in O(log n) and 
keep order automatically. 
Better than hash tables when you need order.

















































































Summary (BST is Fastest When):

You need search + insert/delete + order maintenance together.
You need sorted data structure with dynamic updates.
You need range queries, successor/predecessor, min/max efficiently.
You want to implement ordered sets/maps.

Not fastest when:

Data is static (array/vector is faster).
You need random access by index
(array/vector is O(1), BST is O(log n)).
Tree is unbalanced (worst case O(n)) 
→ must use balanced BST (AVL, Red-Black).
