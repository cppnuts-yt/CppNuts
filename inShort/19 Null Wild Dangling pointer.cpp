ðŸ‘‰ Null Pointer
A pointer that points to nothing.
int* p = nullptr;   // safe, doesnâ€™t point anywhere


ðŸ‘‰ Wild Pointer
An uninitialized pointer that points to an unknown random location.
int* p;   // wild â€“ undefined value inside


ðŸ‘‰ Dangling Pointer
A pointer that used to point to valid memory,
but that memory is freed or out of scope.

int* p = new int(10);
delete p;
std::cout << *p; // dangling


âœ… Summary:

Null â†’ points to nothing (safe).

Wild â†’ never initialized (dangerous).

Dangling â†’ was valid, but now invalid (dangerous).
Would you like me to also make a single small C++ 
demo program showing all three cases with output, 
so you can screen-record it for your short?
