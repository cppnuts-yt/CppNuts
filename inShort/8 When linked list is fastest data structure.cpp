✅ 1. Frequent Insertions/Deletions in the Middle

In a linked list, insertion/deletion only requires changing
a couple of pointers (O(1)), if you already have a pointer 
to the node.






































































✅ 2. Unknown / Variable Size Data

Arrays need fixed size (or resizing in vector).
Linked lists grow/shrink dynamically without reallocation.
Useful when you don’t know the size beforehand.


































































✅ 3. Memory Utilization for Very Large, Fragmented Data

Arrays require contiguous memory. If memory is fragmented,
allocation may fail.
Linked lists can use scattered memory chunks since each node 
is allocated independently.






























































✅ 4. Implementing Stacks/Queues/Deques with Unlimited Size

If you don’t know the upper bound, a linked list avoids 
resizing overhead.
Operations like push_front, push_back, pop_front, 
pop_back are O(1).
































































✅ 5. When Deletions are More Frequent than Access

If the workload is heavy on removals (say from middle of 
the sequence), linked list beats arrays.
For example: LRU cache, memory managers, undo/redo systems.




























































✅ 6. Constant-time Concatenation / Splitting

Joining two linked lists is O(1) (just change a pointer).
Splitting arrays is O(n) because you must copy/shift elements.




















































⚡ Summary (Linked List is Faster When):

Many insertions/deletions in middle.
Size is dynamic / unknown.
Memory is fragmented.
You need fast concatenation/splitting.
But linked lists are not fastest when:
You need random access (O(n) instead of O(1)).
You need good cache performance (nodes are scattered in memory).
Traversals dominate (arrays usually win).
