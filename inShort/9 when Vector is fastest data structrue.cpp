✅ 1. Random Access

Just like arrays, vectors give O(1) random access since 
memory is contiguous.

vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40};
cout << v[2]; // O(1), prints 30
































































✅ 2. Sequential Traversal

Iterating through a vector is very fast due to cache locality,
just like arrays.
Better than linked lists (because nodes of linked lists are
scattered in memory).






















































✅ 3. Dynamic Growth with Amortized O(1) Insertions at End

Unlike raw arrays, vector can grow automatically.
When capacity is exceeded, it allocates a new 
larger block (usually 2×) and copies elements.
Amortized complexity of push_back is O(1).

vector<int> v;
for(int i=0; i<5; i++) v.push_back(i); // amortized O(1)






















































✅ 4. When Size is Unknown but Random Access is Needed

Unlike arrays (fixed size), vectors expand automatically.
Unlike linked lists, vectors support fast index-based access.
























































✅ 5. Memory Efficiency

Less overhead per element compared to linked 
list (no extra pointers).
Usually better memory-to-data ratio.

























































✅ 6. Compatibility with C APIs

Vectors guarantee contiguous storage (&v[0] points to 
first element).
You can pass it to C functions expecting raw arrays.












































⚡ Summary (Vector is Fastest When):

You need O(1) random access but don’t know size in advance.
You want fast sequential traversal.
You insert/remove elements mostly at the end.
You need cache-friendly storage and compatibility with C arrays.

❌ Not fastest when:
Inserting/deleting frequently in the middle/front
Exact size is known then raw array is good 
You want guaranteed O(1) growth without occasional 
reallocations → linked list may be better.
